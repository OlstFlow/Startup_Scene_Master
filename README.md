# Startup Scene Master

**A very simple but handy Blender addon** that lets you quickly load custom startup `.blend` files.

If you work on very different types of projects, this is a great way to avoid setting up your default scene over and over again.

## 🔧 Features:
- Store your scene templates in a separate folder
- Quickly load any template via hotkey (F7)
- Warns before overwriting the current scene
- Auto-loads the selected template after saving the current project

## 📁 How to Use:
1. Install the addon via Preferences > Add-ons > Install.
2. Set the path to your `.blend` template folder in the addon preferences.
3. Press `F7` (by default) to open the template selector dialog. You can reassign this shortcut in the keymap settings if needed.
